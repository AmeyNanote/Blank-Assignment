HURRY RUN

Run and Collect all the Coins, You Win! If the NPC gets more coins then Press F cause you're dead

- Basically I tried to make the game work with C++ but I had no idea how to do the coding because the libraries being used were way too foreign for me to understand. If I had a longer time I may be able to understand C++ however I did put effort into trying to code with C++ however Blueprints were used instead so that I could clearly understand what each library is doing! This gives me a visual layout of what I am doing within the game. Even when coding the AI there are multiple things happening which the visual layout actually helps me decipher. Therefore I used the visual layout to carry out my project.
- I think an interesting feature I added was the cinematic camera after I go into a certain area. The cinematic camera was a little complicated feature to implement but can be done better. This expands the way to do a game and show of the level properly. This has been a feature used in many games.
